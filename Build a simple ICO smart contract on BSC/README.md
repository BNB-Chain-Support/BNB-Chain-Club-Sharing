# Tutorial Series: Build a simple ICO smart contract on BNB Smart Chain

## Introduction

The traditional approach of raising funds for start-ups through venture capital (VC) financing is often an arduous and time-consuming process due to the extensive due diligence conducted by VCs before issuing a term sheet. According to a survey conducted by Harvard Business Review, the findings suggest that the average time taken for VCs to close a deal is about 83 days. Start-ups are required to wait at least 3 months (from the time the term sheet was issued) before they can receive their first tranche of funding from VC. Even if these early-stage companies manage to secure funding from VCs, the cost of capital may not be optimal.

Apart from VC financing, an alternative source of funding is business loans from financial institutions. These loans often require borrowers to pledge collateral(s) of similar value as the principal amount requested. The collateral requirements imposed by financial institutions create a significant barrier to such loan facilities for start-ups that adopt asset-light strategies or service-based business models since they do not have sufficient collateral to secure the loan. Other factors such as short business history, which makes it hard for lenders to gauge start-upsâ€™ ability to repay the loan, have also contributed to the problem of inadequate access to funding for start-ups.

Start-ups generally have limited access to capital, and the financing options that are available often involve lengthy processes and proactive engagements with prospective investors. To improve access to capital and reduce the overall time taken to receive funding for start-ups, an initial coin offering (ICO) service may interest you as an alternative to the above-mentioned traditional financing vehicles.

<!-- ## Steps
Since BSC was created after BC, there are some tokens on BC issued earlier are not existing on BSC yet. In the below steps we will issue a token called BCC (BNB Chain Club token) with a total circulation of 21,000,000 on testnet of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

### Issue token BCC on BNB Beacon Chain
1. Import your account mnemonic into tbnbcli and set a passphrase

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ tbnbcli keys add isaackey --recover`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The key name after add is customized, here just use isaackey for an example.) -->
